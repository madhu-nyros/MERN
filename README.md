# MERN

MERN task

This is the inter school sports competetion demo app.

I developed this app by using MERN stack technologies.

The main purpose of this app is to "participate the sports" 

 
*when the user loggedin then immediately user can see the list of sports in grid formate,user can see also join here button,when the user click the join here button its statue changed to joined.
*user can edit their profile also.
*if user wants to unjoin from the sports,yes user can do that also.
*user can see the list of players participated in each sport. 

How to run the app:

 start the reactjs server:

 *open the terminal and go to the folder where the reactjs file is located then type this command like npm start
 *we can stop the server just type ctrl+c

 start the nodejs server:
 
 *open the terminal and go to the file through terminal then start the server by typing this command  node "filename"
 example:node server (server is the filename).
 *we can stop the server just type ctrl+c

after doing this,By default the browser runs the app.

node folder is for backend.It  contains sample.js file,in that file i wrote the backend code.

sports folder is for frontend.It contains the nodemodules and src  and some other folders.
